# GalvanicSkinResponse
GSR App for Iphone, requires a small hardware addition to run. 

Wouldn't it be interesting if you could create the classical galvanic skin response, or e-meter used by scientologists without a circuit? This is one way to do that using low frequency bioimpedance spectoscopy(50Hz) AC sine waves instead of the classic DC. Check it out! 

Here is a link to the original instructables article with details on how to make the electrodes.
