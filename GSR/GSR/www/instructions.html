<p>Galvanic Skin Response measures tiny changes in conductance as you respond to different stimuli. Traditionally used as a lie detector or in therapy sessions to ascertain the patients true feelings, the technique is based on increased secretions of microsweat during sympathetic arousal from areas with high densities of sweat glands. One of these areas is the tip of the finger which is why we suggest placing the sensor pads at the tip of the finger. </p>
